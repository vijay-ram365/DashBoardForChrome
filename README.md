# DashBoardForChrome
DashBoard extension for Crome Browsers

This project started as a challenge to recreate the Momentum Chrome extension.

The DashBoard project here demonstrates skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working with API's.

I'd like to thank Scrimba for the weather API and for the amazing courses they have.
